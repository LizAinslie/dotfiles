## Installation & Software used
Below is the software I use and how to get it. Run the included [install script
](install.sh) to install all these dependencies as well as copy the required 
config files to their respective locations.

### Fish 
My preferred shell is Fish. To install, run `pacman -S fish`.

### Neofetch
Pretty system information with distro art or images. To install, run `pacman -S
neofetch`. Add w3m with `pacman -S w3m` to get image support.

### Spectacle
My preferred screenshot tool. To install, run `pacman -S spectacle`. I use a
custom wrapper script to upload resulting screenshots to an image host, which
has not been included in this repo as it is specialized for a private host.
