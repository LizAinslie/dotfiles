## Software used
Below is the software I use and how to get it.

### Fish 
My preferred shell is Fish. To install, run `pacman -S fish`

### Neofetch

Pretty system information with distro art or images. To install, run `pacman -S
neofetch`

### Spectacle
My preferred screenshot tool. To install, run `pacman -S spectacle`. I use a
custom wrapper script to upload resulting screenshots to an image host, which
has not been included in this repo as it is specialized for a private host.
